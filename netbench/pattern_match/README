Accelerated Network Technologies @ FIT - NetBench
=================================================

Software requirements:
1) Python module "bitstring" which can be downloaded from
   http://code.google.com/p/python-bitstring/
2) Tests of clark_nfa, sindhu_prasana-nfa, sourdis_bispo_nfa and nfa_split 
require Modelsim.

Directory structure:
algorithms  - Implementation of pattern match algorithms
bin         - Contains various used Python modules and various tools for 
              handling of network data
experiments - Demonstration of pattern match experiments. Currently contains
              comparison of DFA based and NFA based algorithms.
pcre_parser - Parser of regular expressions in PCRE format. Output of this 
              parser is description of automaton in MSFM format version 2. For 
              description of this format see pcre_parser.py.
rules       - Sets of RE from L7 decoder, Snort and Bro IDS.
tests       - Unit tests for basic Netbench - Pattern Match classes.
vhdl        - VHDL templates and components used by some pattern match 
              algorithms.
.           - Implementation of basic Netbench - Pattern Match classes.

Each of the implemented algorithms has its own test script and script 
demonstrating usage of the algorithm. The name of the test scripts starts 
with test_. Tne name of demonstration scripts is example_of_use.py. Test 
scripts are either in directory of the algorithm or in directory tests. Tests 
can run up to several minutes depending on processor type and speed.

Makefile with targets test or run can be also used to run test or example of 
use. The doc target generates documentation of selected algorithm. Makefile 
can be also run from parent directories to run tests or examples of use for
all algorithms in directory and in any subdirectories. The doc target also
display documentation for all algorithms in directory and in any subdiretories.
Target help will display info about those targets. Complete documentation of
pattern match can be obtained by runing Makefile with target doc in base 
directory of pattern match.
