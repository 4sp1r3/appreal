This file contains descriptions of the script in the tools directory. These scripts are supporting tools for the netbench library.

SIMSCRIPT.SH
------------
This script examines given pcap file and identified flows are stored in output file. Script is using the flowcontext tool in netbench directory. Output file is needed for payload_gen.py.

./simscript file.pcap output.flow

PAYLOAD_GEN.PY
--------------

This script generates payload for each flow from the given pcap file into specific file. List of the flows is a parameter of the script together with the pcap file.

List of all flows in the file has to be generated with the special script called simscript.sh, which is mentioned above.

Basic usage of payload_gen is as follows:

./payload_gen file.pcap output.flow

Files with flows are stored in ./tmp directory, unless specified otherwise. Other options can enable generating also the packet payloads or injecting of strings generated from given regular expressions. All options with descriptions can be shown using parameter -h or --help.

COMPARE.PY
----------

This script compares the matching results of PCRE library (pcregrep) and deterministic automaton with perfect hashing and faulty transition table. Basic inputs are file with regular expressions and directory with flows generated by previous script. Result is number of false negatives, false positives and computed values of precision, recall and F-measure printed on stdout.

./compare.py rules.pcre pcap_dir/

There are lots of others options for customizing the automaton and PHF table. All options with descriptions can be shown using parameter -h or --help.

pcre-8.20
---------

This directory contains modified source code of pcregrep, which is used by the compare.py script.

GENERATE_HITS.PY
----------------

Experimental script for generating strings from given regular expressions. Rules are randomly selected from the file specified as first parameter. Number of generated strings is set as second parameter. Output format for one string is as follows:
    Rule: N
    generated_text
